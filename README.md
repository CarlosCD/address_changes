Address Changes
===============

Simple Rails web app to record the remote IP address and notify of changes.

## Basics

- Rails 4.2.10 application
- Ruby 2.4.3
- PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 9.6.1.1)

## Tests

In a macOS, after installing growl (see <https://github.com/CarlosCD/growl>), run:

    guard

And keep it running as you change the code. It will notify you via growl on how are the tests doing.
